# Deploying a new node

Each node should run Debian 11.

## Installation Process

This is the process to follow when setting up a new node to host karatsuba services.
When selecting packages to install, uncheck all except base. Create user named `dev` to use as non-root user.

## Postinstall

Install an openssh server so ansible can have access to the system.
```
$ apt install openssh-server
```
Next give the dev user sudo
```
$ apt install ssh
$ usermod -aG sudo dev
```
