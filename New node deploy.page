# Deploying a new node

Each node should run Debian 11.

## Installation Process

This is the process to follow when setting up a new node to host karatsuba services.
When selecting packages to install, uncheck all except base. Create user named `dev` to use as non-root user.

## Postinstall

Install an openssh server so ansible can have access to the system.
```
$ apt install openssh-server
```
Next give the dev user sudo
```
$ apt install ssh
$ usermod -aG sudo dev
```

## Deploy front proxy and vpn

Before deploying any services we need to set up the envoy proxy and establish a vpn connection to `front-vpn`.
```
$ ansible-playbook -K front-envoy/deploy.yml
```
Now copy the wireguard peer config file from `front-vpn` to `front-envoy` at `/config/wg0.conf`. Now just restart the vpn container and the connection should be up.
