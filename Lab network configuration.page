## Background

The main router runs OpenWRT.  It can be configured either by the web ui or by sshing into the router.
The router has 4 switch ports, each connected to the wall ethernet port in the individual rooms.

If configuring the router through ssh, the main config file is at `/etc/config/network`, just make sure to run 
```
$ /etc/init.d/network reload
```
after editing the config.
